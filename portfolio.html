                    I was born on April 16,1992 in Chicago,IL.
                    From a early age I grew up in a great decade where I instantly fell in love with the game of basketball because the 90's Chicago Bulls.
                    Although I was a Bulls fan my favorite player that i idolized was Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant.
                    I began playing basketball at a competetive level when i was 6 years old.

                        Going Downtown Chicago was one of my favorite experience at a early age. Getting polishes from Maxwell, seeing the Series Tower up close, going to the Shedd Aquarium.
                        For Elementary school I began my education at Walt Disney Magnet School.
